      <p>
        I have a passion for Front End Engineering; if you have yet to inspect
        this websites you would find that React + SASS are my bread and butter.
        While my passion for the front end has not waivered much over the years,
        the reasons why I'm passionate and the technologies powering them most
        certainly have.
        <br />
        <br />I was not always a software engineer, I was a graphic designer
        first. I earned my B.A. in Graphic Design Communications at Roger
        Williams University in 2015, however during my tail end of my collegiate
        career I became more interested in UI Design and then web development.
        What exactly happens to my website designs after a coder has it?

        I took some intro to HTML and CSS courses and instantly loved it. I felt
        as though I could take all of my graphic design skills and apply them to
        an entirely new canvas. I was pretty bad at first, but I saw the
        potential so stuck with it. I took a followup class on Responsive Design
        and Bootstrap, and I really started to see a bigger picture taking
        shape. With HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap I felt like I had a solid
        foundation of web development, so I applied around and landed my first
        position as an Associate Software Engineer at Gartner. While there I
        helped rebuild Gartner for Marketing Leaders utilizing Hippo CMS, sent
        out email blasts, and maintained the Digital Marketing Transit Map, all
        in an agile scrum environment. I also began teaching myself JavaScript
        and SASS, though they proved to be more difficult to grasp conceptually
        than HTML and CSS.

        <br />I decided to leave Gartner in 2017 to be closer with my family as
        I work through some personal health issues. When I was back on my feet I
        decided two things - I want to live and work as a Software Engineer in
        Boston, and I don't know enough to do that. My strong grasp on HTML,
        CSS, and Bootstrap was enough to get a portfolio website off the ground
        and showcase to possible employers, but none were biting. My
        fundamentals weren't going to cut it in Boston, not to mention I am
        still struggling with JavaScript basics and I don't even know what the
        back end is.

        <br />
        To break the mold and enter the Boston Engineering job market with a
        little more valuable skills, I attended General Assembly's coding
        bootcamp Web Development Immersive, WDI (now Software Engineering
        Immersive, SEI). Best decision of my life. Not only did I formally learn
        JavaScript from the ground up, I was taught way more than I ever
        anticiapted - MVC patterns with multiple tech stacks, relational
        database management, GitHub, Node, the command line, user
        authentication, front end javascript frameworks and libraries, UI
        libraries, the list goes on. A massive knowledge gap had been filled. My
        education did not stop there either. Shortly after earning my
        certificate of completion for General Assembly, I taught myself how to
        connect to Soptify's OAuth API, and I started learning how to build in
        React. I quickly built out a small portfolio website as well and was
        soon hired at Wayfair as a Software Engineer coming in through the Labs
        program.

        Wayfair Labs, for those of you who aren't aware, is a 3 month period to
        determine your strengths as an engineer before placing you onto a team.
        Myself and 15 other engineers were hired at the same time and worked
        together to individually complete month long projects which were
        reviewed and used as a basis for placement considerations - one was
        backend focused, one was front end focused, and the final was fullstack.
        I was initially placed on the Asia Consolidations back end team which
        struck me as odd. I expressed my desire to work on the front end and
        worked with my manager to find a team which I would excel in, and we
        landed on the Storefront Discover's Navigation Team. Storefront is in
        charge of all customer facing websites, including subsidiaries. Discover
        was in charge of helping customers quickly find the products or services
        they are looking for, and the Navigation Team was specifically in charge
        of the Header and Footer. I joined the team a few months before we were
        going to decouple the Navigations code assets from a monorepo into a
        microservice webpack environment, which we also coincided with adoption
        React 16.8 in the process. As a result I had a hand in rebuilding the
        components of the Header, working very closely with our Team Lead,
        Project Manager, UI designers, QA Testers, Business Analysts, Back End
        Ebngineers, and fellow Front End Engineers to ensure the header was
        optimized for performance and working perfectly for the millions of
        customers who will see it.

        <br />I saw an opportunity to improve our efforts as we were developing
        by including Accessibility into our components, something I have a
        pet-passion for and something we were lacking in our previous build. I
        suggested it to my manager who was surprised and relieved I knew how to
        do it and wanted to take up the efforts, so he happily handed me the
        tickets he had opened on the subject and I started injecting a11y
        throughout our completed components. I also coached several other team
        members with Accessibility best practices and eventually we adopted it
        as a standard requirement criteria on all tickets involving new
        components. I took this momentum and worked with it to launch an Awesome
        Learning course (Wayfairs fancy term for training module) on
        Accessibility. I started to manage a few other engineers on the side of
        my normal engineering work to devise a plan to instill empathy into
        engineers (ie, can you navigate this site with your eyes closed?) and
        then teach them 3-4 beginner-level best practices to code and easily
        port over into their personal work (ie, using tabindex). Things were
        going smoothly.

        Until the Wayfair layoffs of Feb 2020. I, along with hundreds of others
        were let go just a few weeks before Covid hit. At first I really
        struggled, then I started to build myself up again brick by brick. I
        have been slowly building this current website as a way to demonstrate
        some of the coding skills I have honed since General Assembly, but it
        has been a slow process. However, I continue to build every single day
        as well as continue to teach myself new technologies, such as Redux, to
        improve my marketability and be prepared to add value to your company on
        day one. I am actively looking for work in the Boston area and would
        love to talk about any front end engineering positons you may have
        available at this time.
