While my passion for the\n        front end has not waivered much over the years, the reasons why I'm\n        passionate and the technologies powering them most certainly have. The\n        following is a brief summary of my journey as a software engineer,\n        accompanied by some milestone projects I completed along the way.\n        <br />\n        <br />I was not always a software engineer, I was a graphic designer\n        first. I earned my B.A. in Graphic Design Communications at Roger\n        Williams University in 2015, however during my tail end of my collegiate\n        career I became more interested in UI Design and then web development.\n        What exactly happens to my website designs after a coder has it?\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"http://seandonnellan.com/images/design/flatmates_proposal.pdf\"\n        >\n          FlatMates, app proposal and UI Design, 2014\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I took some intro to HTML and CSS courses and instantly loved it. I felt\n        as though I could take all of my graphic design skills and apply them to\n        an entirely new canvas. I was pretty bad at first, but I saw the\n        potential so stuck with it. I took a followup class on Responsive Design\n        and Bootstrap, and I really started to see a bigger picture taking\n        shape. With HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap I felt like I had a solid\n        foundation of web development, so I applied around and landed my first\n        position as an Associate Software Engineer at Gartner. While there I\n        helped rebuild Gartner for Marketing Leaders utilizing Hippo CMS, sent\n        out email blasts, and maintained the Digital Marketing Transit Map, all\n        in an agile scrum environment. I also began teaching myself JavaScript\n        and SASS, though they proved to be more difficult to grasp conceptually\n        than HTML and CSS.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170221085142/https://www.gartner.com/marketing/\"\n        >\n          Gartner for Marketing Leaders, 2017\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <Link\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/data-tools/transit-map\"\n        >\n          Gartner Digital Marketing Transit Map, 2017\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />I decided to leave Gartner in 2017 to be closer with my family as\n        I work through some personal health issues. When I was back on my feet I\n        decided two things - I want to live and work as a Software Engineer in\n        Boston, and I don't know enough to do that. My strong grasp on HTML,\n        CSS, and Bootstrap was enough to get a portfolio website off the ground\n        and showcase to possible employers, but none were biting. My\n        fundamentals weren't going to cut it in Boston, not to mention I am\n        still struggling with JavaScript basics and I don't even know what the\n        back end is.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://seandonnellan.com/index.html\">\n          seandonnellan.com, portfolio v1, 2017\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        To break the mold and enter the Boston Engineering job market with a\n        little more valuable skills, I attended General Assembly's coding\n        bootcamp Web Development Immersive, WDI (now Software Engineering\n        Immersive, SEI). Best decision of my life. Not only did I formally learn\n        JavaScript from the ground up, I was taught way more than I ever\n        anticipated - MVC patterns with multiple tech stacks, relational\n        database management, GitHub, Node, the command line, user\n        authentication, front end javascript frameworks and libraries, UI\n        libraries, the list goes on. A massive knowledge gap had been filled. My\n        education did not stop there either. Shortly after earning my\n        certificate of completion for General Assembly, I taught myself how to\n        connect to Soptify's OAuth API, and I started learning how to build in\n        React. I quickly built out a small portfolio website as well and was\n        soon hired at Wayfair as a Software Engineer coming in through the Labs\n        program.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"www.seandonn-boston.github.io\">\n          seandonn-boston.github.com, portfolio v2, 2018\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Wayfair Labs, for those of you who aren't aware, is a 3 month period to\n        determine your strengths as an engineer before placing you onto a team.\n        Myself and 15 other engineers were hired at the same time and worked\n        together to individually complete month long projects which were\n        reviewed and used as a basis for placement considerations - one was\n        backend focused, one was front end focused, and the final was fullstack.\n        I was initially placed on the Asia Consolidations back end team which\n        struck me as odd. I expressed my desire to work on the front end and\n        worked with my manager to find a team which I would excel in, and we\n        landed on the Storefront Discover's Navigation Team. Storefront is in\n        charge of all customer facing websites, including subsidiaries. Discover\n        was in charge of helping customers quickly find the products or services\n        they are looking for, and the Navigation Team was specifically in charge\n        of the Header and Footer. I joined the team a few months before we were\n        going to decouple the Navigations code assets from a monorepo into a\n        microservice webpack environment, which we also coincided with adoption\n        React 16.8 in the process. As a result I had a hand in rebuilding the\n        components of the Header, working very closely with our Team Lead,\n        Project Manager, UI designers, QA Testers, Business Analysts, Back End\n        Engineers, and fellow Front End Engineers to ensure the header was\n        optimized for performance and working perfectly for the millions of\n        customers who will see it.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wayfair.com/header\">\n          Wayfair Header, 2020\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />I saw an opportunity to improve our efforts as we were developing\n        by including Accessibility into our components, something I have a\n        pet-passion for and something we were lacking in our previous build. I\n        suggested it to my manager who was surprised and relieved I knew how to\n        do it and wanted to take up the efforts, so he happily handed me the\n        tickets he had opened on the subject and I started injecting a11y\n        throughout our completed components. I also coached several other team\n        members with Accessibility best practices and eventually we adopted it\n        as a standard requirement criteria on all tickets involving new\n        components. I took this momentum and worked with it to launch an Awesome\n        Learning course (Wayfairs fancy term for training module) on\n        Accessibility. I started to manage a few other engineers on the side of\n        my normal engineering work to devise a plan to instill empathy into\n        engineers (ie, can you navigate this site with your eyes closed?) and\n        then teach them 3-4 beginner-level best practices to code and easily\n        port over into their personal work (ie, using tabindex). Things were\n        going smoothly.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"www.seandonn.io\">\n          seandonn.io, portfolio v3\n        </Link>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Until the Wayfair layoffs of Feb 2020. I, along with hundreds of others\n        were let go just a few weeks before Covid hit. At first I really\n        struggled, then I started to build myself up again brick by brick. I\n        have been slowly building this current website as a way to demonstrate\n        some of the coding skills I have honed since General Assembly, but it\n        has been a slow process. However, I continue to build every single day\n        as well as continue to teach myself new technologies, such as Redux, to\n        improve my marketability and be prepared to add value to your company on\n        day one. I am actively looking for work in the Boston area and would\n        love to talk about any front end engineering positions you may have\n        available at this time.\n      </p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
